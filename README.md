- Spring 2019 CPSC 351-03/0X Project 1
- C++
- How to execute and run:
  - Download and unzip file
  - Open terminal in directory and run "make"
  - Open up another terminal and run "./sender message.txt" where message.txt is a default file we included (can be any file)
  - Go back to the first terminal (or a new instance) and run "./recv"
  - Both programs should execute and should store the data in "recvfile"
