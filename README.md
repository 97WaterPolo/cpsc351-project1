- C++
- How to execute and run (assuming you have "make" and "g++" or a variation):
  - Download and unzip file
  - Open terminal in directory and run "make"
  - Using the same terminal, run "./recv"
  - Create a new terminal instance and run "./sender message.txt" where message.txt is a default file we included (can be any file)
  - Both programs should execute and should store the data in "recvfile" and outprint contents to the reciever terminal.
- We did **NOT** implement the extra credit
- No special notes when executing program.

This project was a group effort and we all contributed equally to it. We all met up outside of class time and sat down and discussed how this project worked and how to implement it. We ran into a lot of issues understanding the project but we all worked together to ensure that it all worked. A lot of our effort was spent on debugging the program on various machines to make sure that they all work. **Each memeber had a hand in understanding the concepts of the project, designing the layout of the code, programming of the project, debugging of the compiled program, and writing the documentation.**
